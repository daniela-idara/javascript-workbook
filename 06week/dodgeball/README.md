# Dodgeball - Code Plan
## Checkpoint 2

*First Step:*
Starting with a list of people, we add them to the lineup of potential Dodgeball players.
By clicking the button, people are removed from 'People' and added to 'Players'.

*Second Step:*
The list of 'Players' have the attributes as a 'Person' carried over.
The 'Players' can be drafted to the RED or BLUE team, by click of the color/team selector button.

*Third Step:*
The 'Players' attributes are extended to the 'Team Member' list.
Once the button is clicked, they are removed from the 'Players' and added to the 'Team Member' list.
Depending on the team they are assigned, they will receive a constructor and value to describe the 'color' and 'mascot'.
